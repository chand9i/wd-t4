## üì± Responsive Breakpoints

```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
/* Small devices (phones, 480px and down) */
@media (max-width: 480px) { ... }

/* Medium devices (tablets, 768px and down) */
@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }

/* Large devices (desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
```

## üéÆ Interactive Features

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Alt + 1,2,3,4`: Navigate to sections
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 1,2,3`: Quick API data fetch
- `Arrow Keys`: Navigate carousel (when focused)
- `Space`: Pause/play carousel

### Progress Tracking
- Automatic progress saving to localStorage
- Visual progress indicator
- Section visit tracking
- Completion badges for each component

## üîß Setup and Usage

1. **Clone or Download** the project files
2. **Open** `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. **Interact** with the different sections:
   - Test the responsive design by resizing your browser
   - Take the interactive quiz
   - Navigate through the image carousel
   - Fetch data from various APIs

## üìö Learning Path

### Phase 1: Responsive Design
1. Examine the CSS media queries in `styles/main.css`
2. Resize your browser to see responsive behavior
3. Study the grid layout implementation
4. Experiment with different viewport sizes

### Phase 2: JavaScript Interactivity
1. Review the quiz logic in `scripts/quiz.js`
2. Study the carousel implementation in `scripts/carousel.js`
3. Understand event handling and DOM manipulation
4. Explore object-oriented programming patterns

### Phase 3: API Integration
1. Examine the fetch implementations in `scripts/api.js`
2. Study error handling and loading states
3. Understand caching mechanisms
4. Learn about asynchronous JavaScript patterns

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Quiz Questions
```javascript
window.quiz.addQuestion({
    question: "Your question here?",
    options: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
    correct: 0, // Index of correct answer
    explanation: "Explanation of the correct answer"
});
```

### Adding New Carousel Slides
```javascript
window.mainCarousel.addSlide(`
    <div class="carousel-content">
        <h3>Your Title</h3>
        <p>Your description</p>
    </div>
`);
```

### Customizing API Endpoints
```javascript
// In scripts/api.js
this.apiEndpoints = {
    // Add your custom API endpoints here
    custom: 'https://your-api-endpoint.com/data'
};
```
